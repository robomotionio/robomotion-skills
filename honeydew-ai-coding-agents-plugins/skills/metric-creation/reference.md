## Composing from Existing Metrics

Honeydew accepts named metric references nearly everywhere you'd otherwise write a raw
aggregation — inside `FILTER (WHERE ...)`, inside `GROUP BY (...)` (both fixed and
nested), and as operands in derived arithmetic. Whenever an existing metric can be the
building block of your new metric, **prefer the named-metric form**. It expresses business
intent, inherits future changes to the base metric, and keeps the model DRY.

| New metric pattern                            | Preferred (named-metric form)                       | Raw fallback                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Filtered version of a base metric             | `orders.revenue FILTER (WHERE orders.region='US')`  | `SUM(orders.amount) FILTER (WHERE orders.region='US')` |
| Same metric at a fixed grouping               | `orders.revenue GROUP BY (orders.region)`           | `SUM(orders.amount) GROUP BY (orders.region)`         |
| Same metric inside a nested grouping (`*, x`) | `orders.revenue GROUP BY (*, orders.order_date)`    | `SUM(orders.amount) GROUP BY (*, orders.order_date)`  |
| Distinct count of a related entity            | `customers.count FILTER (WHERE orders.order_id IS NOT NULL)` | `COUNT(DISTINCT orders.customer_id)`        |
| Arithmetic on existing metrics                | `orders.revenue - orders.cost`                      | (no raw equivalent)                                   |

The raw fallback is the right choice **only** when no named metric for the base
aggregation exists, or — for cross-entity counts — when there's no relation between the
two entities. Otherwise, prefer the named-metric form.

> Entities auto-generate a `count` metric. Check before reaching for
> `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(entity.key_field)` — `entity.count` is almost always already there.

### Filtered aggregations

Apply a filter to any named metric or raw aggregation with `FILTER (WHERE ...)`:

```sql
-- Preferred: named-metric form
orders.revenue FILTER (WHERE orders.color = 'red')
orders.count FILTER (WHERE orders.status = 'completed')

-- Even better: also reference a boolean calc attribute as the predicate when one exists
orders.count FILTER (WHERE orders.is_completed)
bookings.count FILTER (WHERE bookings.is_cancelled)
hosts.count FILTER (WHERE hosts.is_top_rated)

-- Raw aggregation fallback
SUM(orders.price) FILTER (WHERE orders.color = 'red')
```

The reuse principle applies to filter predicates the same way it applies to base
aggregations. If a boolean calculated attribute already encodes the predicate (e.g.
`bookings.is_cancelled = bookings.status = 'cancelled'`), reference it by name instead
of inlining the comparison. The metric reads as business intent and inherits any future
changes to the attribute definition.

> For complete filter expression syntax (comparisons, strings, SEARCH, dates, booleans, combined conditions) and date handling functions, see the **filtering** skill.

### Fixed and nested grouping

Wrap any named metric or raw aggregation with `GROUP BY (...)` to lock its grain. Use
`GROUP BY (*, dim)` when you want the inner grouping to inherit the user's current
context plus an additional dimension (the dynamic-grouping recipe — inner half of
average-daily-revenue, peak-daily-revenue, and similar metrics).

```sql
-- Preferred: named-metric form
orders.revenue GROUP BY (orders.customer_id)
orders.revenue GROUP BY (*, orders.order_date)

-- Raw aggregation fallback
SUM(orders.amount) GROUP BY (orders.customer_id)
SUM(orders.amount) GROUP BY (*, orders.order_date)
```

### Cross-entity counts

When the goal is to count members of a related entity that appear in the source (e.g.
"users who made a booking"), use the related entity's `count` metric with a `FILTER` that
references a per-row column on the source entity. This forces Honeydew to join the two
entities. Without it, the optimizer may prune the join and return the related entity's
full total.

```sql
-- Filtered count: forces the join, counts only matching members
users.count FILTER (WHERE bookings.booking_id IS NOT NULL)
properties.count FILTER (WHERE bookings.booking_id IS NOT NULL)

-- Simple count: total members with no filtering (also valid)
users.count

-- Raw fallback when no relation exists between the entities
COUNT(DISTINCT bookings.user_id)
```

**Why the filter matters:** the FILTER predicate references `bookings.booking_id` (a
per-row column on bookings), which forces Honeydew to join users to bookings before
counting. The result equals "users with at least one booking" — a subset of total users.

The named form requires a relation between the entities. If no relation exists, use
`COUNT(DISTINCT)` instead.

## Text Summarization

- `AI_SUMMARIZE_AGG(account.churn_reason)` — get a summary of a text column
- `AI_AGG(reservation.reviews, 'Describe common complaints')` — reduce text with a natural language instruction

## Data Types

Every metric has a data type. Choose based on the aggregation result:

| Data Type   | When to use                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `float`     | **Default for most metrics.** SUM, AVG, ratios, percentages |
| `number`    | Integer results: COUNT, COUNT DISTINCT                      |
| `string`    | Text aggregations: LISTAGG, AI_SUMMARIZE_AGG, AI_AGG        |
| `bool`      | Boolean aggregations: BOOLAND_AGG, BOOLOR_AGG               |
| `date`      | Date aggregations: MIN/MAX on dates                         |
| `timestamp` | Timestamp aggregations                                      |
| `time`      | Time aggregations                                           |

> **Default to `float`** unless the metric is clearly a count (use `number`) or text (use `string`).

## Metric Types

| Type                   | Purpose                            | Example                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**              | Standard SQL aggregation           | `SUM(orders.amount)`                   |
| **Derived**            | Arithmetic on existing metrics     | `orders.revenue - orders.cost`         |
| **Filtered**           | Aggregation with fixed WHERE       | `orders.revenue FILTER (WHERE ...)` or `SUM(orders.price) FILTER (WHERE ...)` |
| **Fixed Grouping**     | Always grouped by a dimension      | `orders.revenue GROUP BY (orders.region)` or `SUM(orders.amount) GROUP BY (orders.region)` |
| **Nested Aggregation** | Aggregation of grouped aggregation | `AVG(orders.revenue GROUP BY (*, orders.order_date))` |

## Format Strings

Use `format_string` to control how metric values display in BI tools. Uses spreadsheet-style format expressions (Excel syntax). See https://customformats.com/ to help build expressions.

| Format      | Renders as | Use for                          |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `#,##0`     | 1,234      | Integer with thousands separator |
| `#,##0.00`  | 1,234.56   | Two decimal places               |
| `$#,##0`    | $1,234     | Currency without decimals        |
| `$#,##0.00` | $1,234.56  | Currency with decimals           |
| `0%`        | 12%        | Percentage without decimals      |
| `0.00%`     | 12.34%     | Percentage with decimals         |
