# Phase 05 Plan 01: Constraints Alignment Code Review Reference Summary

**Constraints-linked SwiftUI review/refactor guidance with SwiftUI-only examples and updated checklists.**

## Performance
- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T20:24:52Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T20:27:04Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Added required Constraints reference to the code review/refactor guidance
- Removed tool-specific and formatting-related guidance from review/refactor guidance
- Replaced non-SwiftUI examples with SwiftUI-focused examples and smells

## Task Commits
Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add constraints link and remove disallowed guidance** - `8c194f4` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Replace UIKit or non-SwiftUI examples with SwiftUI-neutral guidance** - `f5574d4` (docs)

**Plan metadata:** pending

## Files Created/Modified
- `swift-patterns/references/code-review-refactoring.md` - Constraints-linked SwiftUI review/refactor reference

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Installed ripgrep for verification**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Add constraints link and remove disallowed guidance)
- **Issue:** `rg` command not available for plan verification
- **Fix:** Installed ripgrep via Homebrew to run the required verification
- **Files modified:** None (local tooling only)
- **Verification:** `rg` ran successfully on the reference file
- **Committed in:** N/A (local tooling)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Verification-only tooling install; no scope change.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
Phase complete, ready for transition.
