# Phase 1: Compliance + Output Foundations Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The skill loads correctly and provides constraints plus standardized refactor/review response templates.
**Verified:** 2026-01-26T07:17:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Skill entry point exposes required metadata and instructions in SKILL.md | ✓ VERIFIED | `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` includes YAML frontmatter and procedural sections like Constraints and templates. |
| 2 | A single Constraints section exists and is referenced by workflows | ✓ VERIFIED | Single `## Constraints` in `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` with workflow note: "All workflows below must follow the Constraints section". |
| 3 | Citation rule restricts sources to the allowlist in references/sources.md | ✓ VERIFIED | Citation rule in `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` references `references/sources.md`, and allowlist exists in `swift-patterns/references/sources.md`. |
| 4 | User can see a standardized refactor response template | ✓ VERIFIED | `## Refactor Response Template` in `swift-patterns/SKILL.md`. |
| 5 | User can see a standardized review response template | ✓ VERIFIED | `## Review Response Template` in `swift-patterns/SKILL.md`. |
| 6 | Templates explicitly require constraints and citation allowlist checks | ✓ VERIFIED | Both templates include "Constraints + citation allowlist check" referencing Constraints and `references/sources.md` in `swift-patterns/SKILL.md`. |

**Score:** 6/6 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` | Agent Skills frontmatter and constraints entry point, plus templates | ✓ VERIFIED | Exists, substantive (189 lines), includes `name: swift-patterns`, `## Constraints`, and template sections. |
| `swift-patterns/references/sources.md` | Citation allowlist for approved sources | ✓ VERIFIED | Exists, substantive (11 lines), includes `# Sources` and `## Allowed URLs`. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` | `swift-patterns/references/sources.md` | Citation allowlist rule | ✓ WIRED | Multiple references to `references/sources.md` in Constraints and templates. |
| `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` | Constraints section | Workflow references | ✓ WIRED | Explicit workflow note and template checks reference Constraints. |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMP-01 | ✓ SATISFIED | None |
| COMP-02 | ✓ SATISFIED | None |
| CORE-05 | ✓ SATISFIED | None |
