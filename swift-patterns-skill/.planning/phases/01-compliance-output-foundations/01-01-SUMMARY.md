# Phase 1 Plan 01: Compliance Output Foundations Summary

**Authoritative SKILL.md constraints entry point with a citation allowlist sources file for compliance.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T07:08:34Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T07:10:44Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Added a single Constraints section with citation allowlist enforcement in `swift-patterns/SKILL.md`.
- Aligned SKILL.md scope guidance with AGENTS.md limits and tightened metadata.
- Created the citation allowlist in `swift-patterns/references/sources.md`.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Align SKILL metadata and constraints entry point** - `076d762` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Create the citation allowlist file** - `f0eaae5` (docs)

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

_Note: TDD tasks may have multiple commits (test → feat → refactor)_

## Files Created/Modified
- `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` - Adds constraints entry point and removes disallowed guidance.
- `swift-patterns/references/sources.md` - Defines citation allowlist URLs.

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
