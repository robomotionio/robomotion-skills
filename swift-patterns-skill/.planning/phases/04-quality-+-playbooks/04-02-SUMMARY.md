# Phase 4 Plan 02: Quality + Playbooks Summary

**Goal-based SwiftUI refactor playbooks for view extraction, navigation migration, and state hoisting with invariant-aligned verification.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 0 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T12:13:30Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T12:13:52Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Created a refactor playbooks reference with invariant-aligned steps and verification
- Linked playbooks into the refactor workflow for discovery at execution time
- Added playbooks to the SKILL quick decision guide and reference index

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create goal-based refactor playbooks** - `8b7607a` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Wire playbooks into refactor workflow and SKILL index** - `648226a` (docs)

**Plan metadata:** Pending

_Note: TDD tasks may have multiple commits (test → feat → refactor)_

## Files Created/Modified
- `swift-patterns/references/refactor-playbooks.md` - Goal-based playbooks with invariants and verification checklists
- `swift-patterns/references/workflows-refactor.md` - Playbook pointer added to refactor workflow
- `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` - Playbooks added to quick decision guide and reference list

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
