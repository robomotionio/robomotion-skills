# Phase 3 Plan 02: SwiftUI Guidance Core Summary

**Scrolling and pagination guidance plus SwiftUI lifecycle-scoped async patterns with @MainActor updates.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T11:12:19Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T11:15:15Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Authored ScrollView guidance with a decision tree and safe pagination triggers.
- Re-scoped concurrency guidance to SwiftUI lifecycle patterns and cancellation checks.
- Wired scrolling and concurrency references into SKILL.md for fast lookup.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Author ScrollView and pagination guidance** - `c13d6dd` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Refocus concurrency guidance on SwiftUI lifecycle and @MainActor** - `c4bac2f` (docs)

**Plan metadata:** docs commit for plan completion

## Files Created/Modified
- `swift-patterns/references/scrolling.md` - ScrollView decision tree and pagination trigger guidance.
- `swift-patterns/references/concurrency.md` - Lifecycle-scoped SwiftUI concurrency patterns.
- `swift-patterns/references/swift-concurrency.md` - Removed legacy deep concurrency guidance.
- `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` - Added scrolling and concurrency reference links.

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
Phase 3 complete. Ready for Phase 4 plans.
