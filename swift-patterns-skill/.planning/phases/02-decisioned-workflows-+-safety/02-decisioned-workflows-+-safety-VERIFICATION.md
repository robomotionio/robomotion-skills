# Phase 2: Decisioned Workflows + Safety Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Users can route requests into refactor vs review workflows with consistent, risk-aware checklists and a shared constraints section.
**Verified:** 2026-01-26T08:03:27Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | User can route a request to review or refactor using explicit intent cues. | ✓ VERIFIED | `swift-patterns/references/decisions.md` includes routing gates and intent examples. |
| 2 | Workflow routing guidance points to the shared Constraints section to prevent drift. | ✓ VERIFIED | `swift-patterns/references/decisions.md` Shared Constraints note; `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` reiterates constraints for all workflows. |
| 3 | The routing decision is documented in a dedicated reference file. | ✓ VERIFIED | Dedicated routing doc at `swift-patterns/references/decisions.md`. |
| 4 | User can apply a SwiftUI refactor checklist that preserves behavior. | ✓ VERIFIED | `swift-patterns/references/workflows-refactor.md` includes a behavior-preserving checklist with verification steps. |
| 5 | User can apply a SwiftUI review checklist with consistent findings. | ✓ VERIFIED | `swift-patterns/references/workflows-review.md` includes findings taxonomy and checklist. |
| 6 | User can identify risk cues that require splitting refactors or adding tests first. | ✓ VERIFIED | Risk cues sections in `swift-patterns/references/workflows-refactor.md` and `swift-patterns/references/workflows-review.md`. |
| 7 | User can follow an invariants list that protects identity and data flow during refactors. | ✓ VERIFIED | `swift-patterns/references/invariants.md` lists identity, state, navigation, async, and data flow invariants. |

**Score:** 7/7 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |

| `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` | Workflow routing section linked to decisions reference | ✓ VERIFIED | 178 lines; includes Workflow Routing section and links to decisions/workflows. |
| `swift-patterns/references/invariants.md` | Identity and data flow invariants for refactors | ✓ VERIFIED | 13 lines; invariants list plus constraints link. |
| `swift-patterns/references/workflows-refactor.md` | Behavior-preserving refactor checklist with risk cues | ✓ VERIFIED | 42 lines; checklist, verification, and risk cues. |
| `swift-patterns/references/workflows-review.md` | Review checklist with findings taxonomy | ✓ VERIFIED | 49 lines; taxonomy, checklist, and risk cues. |

### Key Link Verification
