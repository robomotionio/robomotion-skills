# Phase 02 Plan 02: Decisioned Workflows + Safety Summary

**Shared SwiftUI invariants and review/refactor checklists with risk cues, linked from SKILL.md for discoverability.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T07:57:08Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T07:58:53Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Published a shared invariants list covering identity, state ownership, navigation, async work, and data flow
- Authored review and refactor workflow checklists with taxonomy and risk cues
- Linked new workflow references from SKILL.md routing and reference lists

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add shared invariants list** - `80b93bd` (docs)
2. **Task 2: Create workflow checklists and link from SKILL.md** - `9fd66fa` (docs)

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit after SUMMARY/STATE/ROADMAP update)

## Files Created/Modified
- `swift-patterns/references/invariants.md` - Shared SwiftUI refactor invariants
- `swift-patterns/references/workflows-review.md` - Review checklist with taxonomy and risk cues
- `swift-patterns/references/workflows-refactor.md` - Refactor checklist with risk cues
- `swift-patterns/SKILL.md` - Workflow routing and reference links

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
Phase 2 complete, ready for 03-01-PLAN.md.
