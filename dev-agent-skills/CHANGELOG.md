# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Restructured the repository to the standard Claude Code plugin layout: every plugin is now a self-contained directory under `plugins/` (`plugins/github-workflow`, `plugins/skill-authoring`, `plugins/guardrails`), each with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Marketplace entries reference plugins via `source` only; components are auto-discovered from each plugin directory.

### Fixed

- Skill duplication: `github-workflow` and `skill-authoring` previously shared `source: "./"` (the repo root), so each auto-discovered every directory under `skills/` on top of its explicit `skills` array - `github-workflow` resolved to 9 skills (its 4 doubled, plus `creating-skills`). With per-plugin directories each plugin now resolves only its own skills.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

#### guardrails plugin (new)
- New plugin for running Claude Code with reduced supervision, shipping the `guard-destructive` `PreToolUse` hook for the Bash tool
- Hard-blocks catastrophic commands: `rm -rf /` (and `~` / `$HOME`), `rsync --delete`, `docker rm -v` / `docker volume rm`
- Prompts for confirmation on other destructive operations: `rm` (with resolved-operand enumeration), `rmdir`, `git reset --hard` / `clean -f` / `checkout --` / `restore`, `shred` / `truncate` / `mkfs`, `dd`
- Exempts `rm` whose operands all resolve strictly under a temp directory (`/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/var/folders`); a bare `/tmp` or any path containing `..` is never exempt
- Catches destructive commands wrapped in `ssh '...'` / `sh -c "..."`

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

#### github-pr-review
- Added fallback to `pulls/$PR/reviews/$REVIEW_ID/comments` endpoint when review-attached inline comments are not surfaced by the general `pulls/$PR/comments` endpoint (cross-checks "Actionable comments posted: N" count)
- Added missing CodeRabbit type indicators to severity table (`_🚨 Critical_`, `_⚡ Performance_`)
- Documented secondary color badge override rule (e.g., `_💡 Suggestion_ | _🟠 Major_` binds to HIGH, not MEDIUM)
- Added reference to CodeRabbit global "Prompt for all review comments with AI agents" block for cross-comment context
- Added `?per_page=100` to all fetch API calls to handle PRs with many comments

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

#### github-pr-review
- Added CodeRabbit severity detection to `references/severity_guide.md`: emoji+italic pattern (`_⚠️ Potential issue_`, `_🧹 Nitpick_`, `_🔧 Optional_`, etc.), secondary color badges (`_🟡 Minor_`, `_🟠 Major_`) as binding severity indicator
- Documented CodeRabbit "outside diff" comments pattern: embedded in PR-level review body `<details>` blocks, not in `pulls/$PR/comments`
- Step 1: added `pulls/$PR/reviews` fetch alongside `pulls/$PR/comments` to capture outside diff comments
- Step 1: replaced raw fetch commands with inline `--jq` filters to avoid `!=` operator, which Claude Code's Bash tool escapes as `\!=` breaking jq
- Updated severity table in step 1 with CodeRabbit indicators
- Current PR context now includes milestone: `PR #N: title (state) | Milestone: name`
- Added step 7: verify milestone at end of review; suggest assigning if missing and open milestones exist (never assigns automatically)

#### github-pr-creation
- Added `.s2s/plans/*.md` to task documentation search paths (Spec2Ship projects)
- Added `chore/*`, `ci/*`, `docs/*` branch patterns to title prefix table
- Added breaking change handling: add `breaking` label + `## Breaking changes` body section
- Added step 9: detect open milestones and assign if exactly one is active; ask user if multiple exist
- Updated `gh pr create` command with `--milestone`, `--reviewer`, correct multi-`--label` syntax
- Added `--draft` usage note (WIP, CI wait, AI bot trigger)

#### github-pr-merge
- Added step 2: check PR milestone before merge; warn (not block) if open milestones exist but PR has none
- Added milestone line to pre-merge checklist summary (step 4)
- Added step 7: after merge, check `open_issues` on milestone; offer to close it if all items are done
- Renumbered steps: old 2→3, 3→4, 4→5, 5→6; new steps are 2 and 7
