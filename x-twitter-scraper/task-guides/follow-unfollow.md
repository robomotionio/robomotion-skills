# Follow & Unfollow on X

Follow and unfollow accounts as a connected user, and check follow state.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| POST /x/users/{id}/follow | Follow a user (numeric ID) | Write tier |
| DELETE /x/users/{id}/follow | Unfollow a user (numeric ID) | Write tier |
| GET /x/users/{id} | Resolve @handle to numeric user ID | Read tier |
| GET /x/followers/check?source=<a>&target=<b> | Does A follow B? | Read tier |

Base URL: `https://xquik.com/api/v1`. Auth: `x-api-key: xq_...` header.

## Quick reference

```
POST /x/users/{id}/follow
{ "account": "<connected_username>" }
-> { followed: true }

DELETE /x/users/{id}/follow
{ "account": "<connected_username>" }
```

For follow/unfollow, `{id}` is the numeric user ID. Resolve a @handle with `GET /x/users/{id}` first; the lookup route accepts usernames and numeric IDs.

## Typical flow

1. `GET /x/accounts` to pick the acting account.
2. `GET /x/users/{id}` to resolve each target handle to a numeric `id`.
3. Show the user the target handle and the acting account. Wait for approval.
4. Call `POST /x/users/{id}/follow` to follow, or `DELETE /x/users/{id}/follow` to unfollow.

## Bulk operations

If the user asks to follow or unfollow many accounts at once, list every target first, require explicit confirmation for the full list, then iterate with a short delay (1-2s) between calls to avoid rate limits. Never silently batch.

Hard no:
- Mass-following random accounts based on a scrape
- "Follow everyone who liked my tweet" workflows without user review of the full list
- Unfollowing loops that run in the background

## Errors

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 403 | `target_blocked_you` | Cannot follow a user who blocked this account |
| 422 | `login_failed` | Reconnect in dashboard |
| 429 | `x_api_rate_limited` | Backoff |
