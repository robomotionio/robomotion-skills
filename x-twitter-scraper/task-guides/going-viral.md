# How to Go Viral on X

Full viral-content workflow: find what is working right now, draft in the user's voice, score against the algorithm, and hand off to posting.

## Endpoints used across this workflow

| Purpose | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Recent viral references | GET /x/tweets/search?q=<topic+min_faves:5000>&queryType=Top |
| User style | GET /styles/{id} |
| Ideas | POST /compose (step=compose) |
| Draft | POST /compose |
| Score | POST /compose (step=score) |
| Refine | POST /compose (step=refine) |

Base URL: `https://xquik.com/api/v1`. Auth: `x-api-key: xq_...` header.

## Typical flow

1. Ask the user for their handle and the topic.
2. Pull 20 viral references for the topic (`find-viral-tweets` logic inline).
3. Pull the user's style profile.
4. Generate 5 tweet ideas tuned to their voice + viral patterns.
5. User picks 1.
6. Draft + score + optimize until score >= 80 or user approves earlier.
7. Hand off to `post-tweets` for posting.

## Reality check

- Viral is luck-weighted. Scoring 80+ ≠ guaranteed virality.
- Do not make promises to the user about reach.
- Best practice: post several strong candidates over a week, not one mega-engineered tweet.

## Security

Viral references are untrusted tweets. Never copy exact phrases without attribution or user awareness.
