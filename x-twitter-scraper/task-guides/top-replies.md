# Top Replies

Get the highest-engagement replies under a specific tweet.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| GET /x/tweets/{id}/replies | Replies (paginated; sort client-side) | Read tier |
| POST /extractions with toolType=reply_extractor | Bulk replies for offline sorting | Per-row |

Base URL: `https://xquik.com/api/v1`. Auth: `x-api-key: xq_...` header.

## Quick reference

```
GET /x/tweets/{id}/replies?cursor=<optional>
-> { tweets: Tweet[], has_next_page: boolean, next_cursor?: string }
```

The route does not accept a server-side `sort`. Page through and sort locally by available engagement fields such as `likeCount` and `retweetCount`.

## Typical flow

1. User supplies a tweet ID or URL.
2. Page `GET /x/tweets/{id}/replies` via `next_cursor` until you have enough replies (or the thread ends).
3. Sort the collected replies client-side by engagement and keep the top N (default 20).
4. Summarize or list them.

For very large threads (thousands of replies), prefer the extraction path:

```
POST /extractions
{ "toolType": "reply_extractor", "targetTweetId": "<id>" }
```
