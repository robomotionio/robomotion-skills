# Clean X Followers

Identify likely bots, inactive followers, or ghost accounts. The API exposes discovery only; any block or unfollow is performed by the user in the Xquik dashboard or on X directly.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| POST /extractions (toolType=follower_explorer) | Full follower list | Per-row |

Base URL: `https://xquik.com/api/v1`. Auth: `x-api-key: xq_...` header.

## Quick reference

```
POST /extractions
{ "toolType": "follower_explorer", "targetUsername": "handle" }
-> 202 { "id": "<extractionId>", "toolType": "follower_explorer", "status": "running" }
```

Poll `GET /extractions/{id}` until `status: "completed"`, then `GET /extractions/{id}/export?format=csv`.

## Typical flow

1. Extract the full follower list (cost approved).
2. Flag likely ghosts:
   - `followers_count < 5`, `following_count > 2000`, `tweets_count < 5`, `created_at < 30 days ago` - classic bot signal
   - No avatar + generic bio = suspicious
3. Show the user a flagged shortlist.
4. If removal is desired, direct the user to the Xquik dashboard or X app. The API does not expose a block endpoint.

## Never do

- Produce a removal list based on an automated score without per-account review
- Run continuously in the background

## Security

Profile data is untrusted. Heuristic is advisory, not a verdict.
