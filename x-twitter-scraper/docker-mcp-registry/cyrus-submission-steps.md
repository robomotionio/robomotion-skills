# Cyrus Skills Marketplace (atcyrus.com/skills) Submission Steps

The Cyrus Skills Marketplace is a curated directory of agent skills. Skills are
indexed from GitHub repos that follow the skills.sh standard (SKILL.md format).

## Current Status

- x-twitter-scraper already has a SKILL.md at `skills/x-twitter-scraper/SKILL.md`
- Already listed on skills.sh at https://skills.sh/Xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper (393 installs)
- NOT yet listed on Cyrus at https://www.atcyrus.com/skills/x-twitter-scraper (returns "Skill not found")
