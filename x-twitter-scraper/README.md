An [AI agent skill](https://skills.sh) for [Xquik](https://docs.xquik.com), a Twitter API alternative for developers who need to search tweets, get tweets from profiles, export followers, download media, monitor accounts, and automate posting workflows.

Use it for advanced Twitter search, tweet search API calls, profile tweet scraping, follower export to CSV, media download, tweet scheduling, send tweets, post replies, like, repost, follow, DM, webhooks, MCP, and official SDK workflows from AI coding agents.

Includes 100+ REST API endpoints, 2 MCP tools, HMAC webhooks, 23 bulk extraction tools, and confirmation-gated write actions.

**The cheapest X data API on the market** - post reads from $0.00015/call (about 33x cheaper than official X API post reads).

Works with **40+ AI coding agents** including Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, VS Code, Cline, Roo Code, Goose, Amp, Augment, Continue, OpenHands, Trae, OpenCode, and more.

### Pay-Per-Use (No Subscription)

Two options for pay-per-use without a monthly subscription:

- **Credits**: Start a credit top-up checkout or confirmed quick top-up only after explicit confirmation. Top-up credits cost $0.00015 each. Works with all supported endpoints.
- **MPP**: 32 X-API endpoints accept optional per-call payments. Show the exact amount and get explicit confirmation before starting any payment flow. Use the Xquik billing docs for the current payment client setup.

## Installation

Install via the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh) (auto-detects your installed agents):

```bash
npx skills@1.5.3 add Xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper
```

This installs the primary [`x-twitter-scraper`](https://skills.sh/xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper/x-twitter-scraper) skill, including `SKILL.md` and every file in `references/`.

### Manual Installation

Use manual installation only when the skills CLI is unavailable. Copy the primary skill directory, not the repository root.

```bash
target_dir=".agents/skills/x-twitter-scraper"
tmp_dir="$(mktemp -d)"

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper.git "$tmp_dir/x-twitter-scraper"
rm -rf "$target_dir"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$target_dir")"
cp -R "$tmp_dir/x-twitter-scraper/skills/x-twitter-scraper" "$target_dir"
rm -rf "$tmp_dir"
```
