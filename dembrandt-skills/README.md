## What this is

A set of opinionated, practical skills covering the fundamentals of good UI: hierarchy, typography, accessibility, interaction patterns. Distilled from working across hundreds of products and domains — enterprise tools, SaaS, financial platforms, e-commerce, consumer apps, and more. The kind of UX knowledge that usually lives with a senior designer or consultant.

Use with Claude Code or any agent harness that supports the Open Agent Skills format.
