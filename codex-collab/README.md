Collaborate with [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) from [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Run tasks, get code reviews, do parallel research, all without leaving your Claude session.

codex-collab is a [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that drives Codex through its app server JSON-RPC protocol. It manages threads, streams structured events, handles tool-call approvals, and lets you resume conversations — all without leaving your Claude session.

## Why

- **Structured communication** — Talks to Codex via JSON-RPC over stdio. Every event is typed and parseable.
- **Event-driven progress** — Streams progress lines as Codex works, so Claude sees what's happening in real time.
- **Review automation** — One command to run code reviews for PRs, uncommitted changes, or specific commits in a read-only sandbox.
- **Thread reuse** — Resume existing threads to send follow-up prompts, build on previous responses, or steer the work in a new direction.
- **Approval control** — Configurable approval policies for tool calls: auto-approve, interactive, or deny.

## Installation

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) >= 1.0 and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (`npm install -g @openai/codex`) on your PATH. Tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), macOS, and Windows 10.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kevin7Qi/codex-collab.git
cd codex-collab
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

After installation, **reopen your terminal** so the updated PATH takes effect, then run `codex-collab health` to verify.

The installer builds a self-contained bundle, deploys it to your home directory (`~/.claude/skills/codex-collab/` on Linux/macOS, `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\codex-collab\` on Windows), and adds a binary shim to your PATH. Once installed, Claude discovers the skill automatically.

<summary>Development mode</summary>

Use `--dev` to symlink source files for live-reloading instead of building a bundle:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
./install.sh --dev

# Windows (may require Developer Mode or an elevated terminal for symlinks)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1 -Dev
```

</details>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run a prompted task
codex-collab run "what does this project do?" -s read-only --content-only

# Code review
codex-collab review --content-only

# Resume a thread
codex-collab run --resume <id> "now check error handling" --content-only
```

<summary>Options</summary>

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-d, --dir <path>` | Working directory |
| `-m, --model <model>` | Model name (default: auto — latest available) |
| `-r, --reasoning <level>` | low, medium, high, xhigh (default: auto — highest for model) |

| `--base <branch>` | Base branch for PR review (default: main) |

</details>

## Defaults & Configuration

By default, codex-collab auto-selects the **latest model** (preferring `-codex` variants) and the **highest reasoning effort** supported by that model. No configuration needed — it stays current as new models are released.

To override defaults persistently, use `codex-collab config`:

```bash
# Show current config
codex-collab config

# Set a preferred model
codex-collab config model gpt-5.3-codex

# Set default reasoning effort
codex-collab config reasoning high

# Unset a key (return to auto-detection)
codex-collab config model --unset

# Unset all keys
codex-collab config --unset
```

Available keys: `model`, `reasoning`, `sandbox`, `approval`, `timeout`

CLI flags always take precedence over config, and config takes precedence over auto-detection:

```
CLI flag  >  config file  >  auto-detected
```

Config is stored in `~/.codex-collab/config.json`.
