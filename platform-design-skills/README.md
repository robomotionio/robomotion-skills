# Platform Design Skills

Platform design skill pack: 450+ rules for Apple HIG, Material Design 3, and WCAG 2.2 across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, tvOS, Android, and Web.

Built by scraping the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) (a compiled [PDF version](Apple_HIG.pdf) is included in this repo) and distilling it — along with Material Design 3 and WCAG 2.2 — into succinct but exhaustive skill files. Use them to evaluate, improve, or create your designs.

## Contributing (Pull Requests)

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from the default branch.
- Keep PRs focused to one theme (one platform, one major design area, or one format rule set).
- Update affected skill docs in `skills/<platform>/SKILL.md` and keep `metadata.json` entries aligned when behavior changes.
- If adding or changing rule coverage, ensure:
  - platform skill descriptions remain accurate,
  - source signals in the skill files are still correct,
  - and examples still reflect current platform behavior.
- In the PR description include:
  - what changed,
  - why this matters for AI output quality,
  - and a short before/after usage sample.
- Suggested PR title format: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`.

Example PR checklist:

- [ ] Scope matches the PR title
- [ ] One platform or one rule family per PR
- [ ] No broken relative links in touched files
- [ ] AGENTS/skill assumptions still stated clearly
- [ ] README and skill metadata remain consistent

## Usage

Skills activate automatically when agents detect platform-relevant tasks.

```
Review this SwiftUI view for iOS HIG compliance
```
```
Check this Android Compose screen against Material Design
```
```
Audit this web page for accessibility
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill contains:
- `SKILL.md` — Agent instructions with frontmatter metadata
- `metadata.json` — Version, references, and abstract
- `rules/` — Individual rule files with examples
- `AGENTS.md` — Quick context for agent consumption
