# Maggy v5 Benchmark Results

**Date:** 2026-05-11
**App:** Personal Expense Tracker (FastAPI + SQLite + vanilla HTML/JS)
**Environment:** Mac Studio M4 Max, 128 GB RAM, macOS Darwin 24.6.0
**CLIs:** Claude Code 2.1.42, Codex 0.129.0, Kimi 1.41.0, Ollama 0.23.2 (qwen2.5-coder:32b)

---

## 1. Test Protocol

6 identical tasks run sequentially through two pipelines:

- **Runner A (Maggy):** 4-tier routing via blast score. Auto-discovers CLI flags at startup.
- **Runner B (Claude Code):** All tasks run through `claude -p` only.

Both pipelines use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / equivalent flags, 25 max turns, and subprocess spawning into isolated build directories.

**Claude (18 source files, ~1,500 app lines + 457K with venv):**

| File | Lines | Assessment |
|------|-------|------------|
| `specs/product-spec.md` | 206 | Comprehensive: vision, schema, Pydantic examples, project structure |
| `backend/app/database.py` | 68 | Correct schema, parameterized queries, FK, seed data |
| `backend/app/main.py` | 42 | Lifespan init, CORS from env var, 3 routers |
| `backend/app/models.py` | 51 | Centralized Pydantic schemas (better separation) |
| `backend/app/routes/expenses.py` | 159 | Full CRUD, partial update support, category JOIN |
| `backend/app/routes/categories.py` | 90 | CRUD, referential integrity check on delete |

### 5.2 Quality Scoring

| Dimension | Maggy | Claude | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Functional completeness** | 9/10 | 10/10 | Both implement all endpoints. Claude adds partial updates. |
| **Security** | 10/10 | 7/10 | Maggy's security review (EXP-6) hardened CORS, added amount bounds, path param validation, color format validation. Claude left CORS with `allow_credentials=True`, no amount ceiling, no color validation. |
| **SQL safety** | 10/10 | 10/10 | Both use parameterized queries exclusively. |
| **XSS prevention** | 10/10 | 10/10 | Both use textContent for DOM rendering. No innerHTML. |
| **Input validation** | 9/10 | 7/10 | Maggy: Pydantic + custom validators (hex color, amount ceiling, path ge=1). Claude: Pydantic regex patterns but less thorough. |
| **Error handling** | 9/10 | 8/10 | Maggy: context manager with rollback, 409 on duplicate, 404 on missing. Claude: try/finally, 409 on duplicate, referential integrity check. |
| **Test coverage** | 0/10 | 9/10 | Maggy produced zero tests. Claude created conftest + 3 test files (~200 lines). |
| **Architecture** | 8/10 | 9/10 | Claude separated models into dedicated file. Maggy inlined models per route. Both wire correctly. |
| **Product spec** | 0/10 | 10/10 | Maggy's ollama did not produce a spec file. Claude's spec is comprehensive (206 lines). |
| **Frontend quality** | 9/10 | 8/10 | Maggy's frontend is larger (472+472+121 = 1065 lines) with more CSS detail. Claude's is cleaner (320+323+79 = 722 lines) with modal UX. |
| **Weighted avg** | **7.4/10** | **7.8/10** | |

### 5.3 Key Differences

**Maggy strengths:**
- Security review caught and fixed 7 issues (CORS wildcard, missing bounds, color validation, duplicated validation)
- Multi-model approach applied right tool to right task (security by Claude, CRUD by Codex, schema by Kimi)
- Larger frontend with more CSS polish
- Each model contributed its strength: Claude for security depth, Codex for feature implementation

**Claude strengths:**
- Product spec created (comprehensive 206-line document)
- Test suite included (conftest + 3 test files, ~200 lines, 11+ test cases)
- Better code organization (centralized models.py)
- Partial update support on expenses (PATCH-style PUT)
- Referential integrity check on category delete (prevents orphaned expenses)
- Full venv with dependencies installed

**Maggy weaknesses:**
- No product spec file generated (ollama didn't create it or placed it elsewhere)
- No test files at all — a significant gap for production readiness
- Import paths use `backend.app.` which requires specific project structure to run

**Claude weaknesses:**
- No dedicated security review — CORS uses `allow_credentials=True` (risky with dynamic origins)
- No amount ceiling on expenses (could submit `1e308`)
- No hex color format validation on categories
- `get_db()` returns connection without context manager (manual close in every route)

## 6. Cost Analysis

| Pipeline | Claude Usage | Free/Cheap Usage | Est. Subscription Burn |
|----------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Maggy** | 1/6 tasks (17%) | 2/6 tasks (33%) | Low — spread across 3 subscriptions |
| **Claude** | 6/6 tasks (100%) | 0/6 tasks (0%) | High — 100% on premium model |

Maggy used Claude only for the security review (blast 8). The other 5 tasks consumed cheaper or free models:
- EXP-1: ollama (free, local GPU)
- EXP-2: kimi (free tier / cheap subscription)
- EXP-3/4/5: codex (separate subscription)

This represents ~83% reduction in Claude subscription consumption.

---

## 7. Routing Observations

### What worked
- **Blast 8 → Claude** for security review was correct. Claude produced the most thorough audit.
- **Blast 5 → Codex** for CRUD implementation delivered working endpoints.
- **Blast 3 → Kimi** for database schema was successful and correct.
- **Zero fallbacks** — all 4 CLIs completed tasks without needing to escalate.
- **Auto-discovery** — CLI flags probed from `--help`, not hardcoded.

### What needs tuning
- **Codex is slow on frontend** — EXP-5 took 280s vs Claude's 122s (2.3x slower). Consider routing blast 6 frontend tasks to Claude.
- **Ollama missed the spec task** — EXP-1 (docs) was routed to local model but no spec file was generated. Ollama's qwen2.5-coder is optimized for code, not prose. Consider routing `task_type: docs` to kimi or claude regardless of blast score.
- **No test generation by any Maggy model** — None of the 4 models produced tests. This could be addressed by adding a TDD step (write tests first) as a follow-up task routed to Claude.

## 8. Conclusions

| Metric | Maggy | Claude | Verdict |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Speed | 907.6s | 681.0s | Claude 33% faster |
| Success rate | 100% | 100% | Tie |
| Quality (weighted) | 7.4/10 | 7.8/10 | Claude slightly better |
| Security depth | Stronger | Weaker | Maggy (dedicated review step) |
| Test coverage | None | Good | Claude (significant gap for Maggy) |
| Cost efficiency | 83% savings | Baseline | Maggy |
| Subscription risk | Distributed | Single point | Maggy |
| Model diversity | 4 models | 1 model | Maggy |

**Summary:** Claude Code is faster and produces marginally higher overall quality (driven by tests and spec). Maggy's multi-model approach provides cost efficiency and subscription risk distribution, plus deeper security review via dedicated model routing. The main gaps to close: add TDD pipeline (test generation step), and improve docs routing (don't send prose tasks to coding-optimized local models).

## 9. Raw Throughput Benchmarks (tokens/sec)

Standalone generation speed measured with identical prompts across all four model tiers. Each model ran 3 iterations (1 cold, 2 hot).

**Prompt:** "Write a Python function that implements a binary search tree with insert, delete, search, and in-order traversal."

### 9.1 Results

| Model | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Avg tok/s | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Ollama qwen2.5-coder:32b** | 22.3 | 21.8 | 22.1 | **22.1** | Local GPU (M4 Max), consistent across runs |
| **Claude (claude -p)** | 44.6 (API) / 18.6 (wall) | 41.9 / 14.3 | 25.7 / 6.8 | **37.4 API / 13.2 wall** | API time excludes network overhead; wall-clock includes CLI startup |
| **Kimi (kimi CLI)** | ~1.8 | ~2.8 | ~3.3 | **~2.6** | Agentic mode — writes files, runs tools; tok/s reflects execution time |
| **Codex (codex exec)** | ~0.8 | ~0.7 | ~0.6 | **~0.7** | Agentic mode — full-auto file creation; tok/s reflects execution time |

### 9.2 Interpretation

- **Ollama (local):** Stable 22 tok/s on M4 Max 128GB. No network latency, no rate limits, no cost. Best for blast 1-2 tasks where speed-to-first-token matters.
- **Claude:** Fastest raw generation at ~37 tok/s (API). Wall-clock is lower (~13 tok/s) due to CLI startup overhead and streaming.
- **Kimi / Codex:** Low tok/s numbers are misleading — both operate in agentic mode (writing files, running commands, iterating). Their throughput reflects end-to-end task execution, not pure generation speed. Codex in particular spends most time on sandboxed execution rather than generation.

### 9.3 Routing Implications

| Tier | Model | tok/s | Cost | Best For |
|------|-------|-------|------|----------|
| Local | Ollama qwen2.5-coder:32b | 22 | Free | Blast 1-2: docs, simple scaffolding |
| Mid | Kimi | 2.6 (agentic) | Cheap | Blast 3-4: schema design, CRUD |
| Premium-Auto | Codex | 0.7 (agentic) | Mid | Blast 5-6: feature implementation |
| Premium | Claude | 37 (API) | High | Blast 7+: security, architecture, TDD |

## 10. Post-Benchmark Fixes (Routing Rules + Conventions)

Three systems were built immediately after the benchmark to close the gaps above.

### 10.1 Routing Rules (`~/.maggy/routing-rules.yaml`)

A self-updating YAML config that overrides blast-score routing for specific task types and pipeline phases. Rules are checked **before** the reward table or blast-score tier.

**Task-type overrides seeded from benchmark evidence:**

| Task Type | Forced To | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| `docs` | claude | Ollama (code-optimized) produced no spec file |
| `security` | claude | Security review needs deep reasoning |
| `tests` | claude | Only claude generated test files in benchmark |
| `architecture` | claude | Architecture needs cross-context awareness |
| `planning` | claude | Planning requires structured reasoning |

**Pipeline phase overrides from TDD workflow:**

| Phase | Forced To | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `spec` | claude | SPEC phase needs comprehensive docs |
| `tdd_red` | claude | RED phase needs test design expertise |
| `tdd_green` | auto | GREEN uses blast-score routing (cheap models can implement) |
| `review` | claude | Review needs security + architecture depth |

**Self-learning:** `record_outcome()` updates rolling success rates per model. `learn_override()` lets Maggy add new rules when outcome data supports it. Manual YAML edits are preserved.

### 10.2 Team Conventions Injection

Five conventions from claude-bootstrap's CLAUDE.md are embedded in routing rules and injected into every prompt sent to any CLI:

1. **mWP** — Build minimum wowable product. No feature flags, no premature abstractions.
2. **TDD** — RED → GREEN → VALIDATE. Coverage >= 80%.
3. **Security** — No secrets in code. Parameterized SQL. Validate input at boundaries.
4. **Quality gates** — 20 lines/fn, 3 params, 2 nesting levels, 200 lines/file.
5. **Existing patterns** — Read codebase before changing. Keep changes minimal.

All four executor prompt methods (`_plan_prompt`, `_analysis_prompt`, `_tests_prompt`, `_impl_prompt`) now append matching conventions. This standardizes quality expectations across kimi, codex, ollama, and claude.

### 10.3 Expected Re-run Improvements

| Benchmark Gap | Root Cause | Fix Applied | Expected Result |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| No product spec (EXP-1) | `docs` routed to ollama | `docs → claude` override | Claude generates spec |
| No tests from any model | No TDD step in pipeline | `tdd_red → claude` + `tests → claude` overrides | Claude writes failing tests |
| Inconsistent quality across models | No shared standards | Conventions injected into all prompts | mWP + quality gates enforced everywhere |
| No learning from outcomes | Static routing only | `record_outcome()` + `learn_override()` | Routing improves with each task |

**Projected scores if re-run:**

| Dimension | Before | After (est.) | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Product spec | 0/10 | 9/10 | `docs → claude` |
| Test coverage | 0/10 | 8/10 | `tdd_red → claude` |
| Security | 10/10 | 10/10 | No change (already strong) |
| Architecture | 8/10 | 9/10 | Conventions enforce patterns |
| **Weighted avg** | **7.4/10** | **~8.5/10** | **+1.1 points** |

Cost efficiency would remain at ~83% savings — the new overrides only force claude for `docs` (1 task) and `tests` (new TDD step), not for CRUD/API/frontend work.
