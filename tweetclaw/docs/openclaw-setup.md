# OpenClaw Setup Guide

Use this guide when installing, configuring, or verifying TweetClaw in OpenClaw. It is optimized for agent retrieval and keeps the setup path short, current, and public-safe.

## What TweetClaw Adds

TweetClaw is the `@xquik/tweetclaw` OpenClaw plugin for Xquik X/Twitter workflows. It registers 2 structured tools:

- `explore`: free local catalog search with no network request.
- `tweetclaw`: live endpoint invoker for catalog-listed Xquik API paths.

The plugin can install before credentials exist. Without credentials, `explore` remains usable and live calls return setup guidance.

## Install

Install the published package:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @xquik/tweetclaw
```

TweetClaw publishes npm-first install metadata with the exact `@xquik/tweetclaw` package version. Use the ClawHub page for browsing only while its listing lags behind npm. Avoid repo-folder installs for release-like verification because they do not represent the published artifact.

## Verify Runtime Loading

After install or update, inspect the runtime and bundled skill:

```bash
openclaw plugins inspect tweetclaw --runtime
openclaw skills info tweetclaw
```

Expected result:

- The `tweetclaw` plugin loads.
- The `explore` tool is available.
- The optional `tweetclaw` tool is available when the OpenClaw tool profile allows it.
- The TweetClaw skill is visible to the agent.

## Enable The Optional Tool

Many OpenClaw profiles keep a coding-focused tool set by default. If the skill is visible but the agent cannot call TweetClaw tools, add the 2 tool names to `tools.alsoAllow`:

```bash
openclaw config set tools.alsoAllow '["explore", "tweetclaw"]'
```

Use `tools.alsoAllow` instead of replacing the whole tool profile unless strict allowlist mode is intentional.

## Credential Modes

TweetClaw has 3 modes:

| Mode | Required config | Use it for |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Explore-only | none | Install checks, docs, and endpoint discovery |
| API key | `plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.apiKey` | Account-backed reads, writes, extraction, monitors, webhooks, media, commands, and account status |
| MPP | `plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.tempoSigningKey` | 31 read-only pay-per-use endpoints with no Xquik account |

Store credentials in OpenClaw plugin config. Never paste API keys, signing keys, passwords, cookies, account IDs, or payment material into chat, docs, issues, logs, screenshots, or tool arguments.

API key mode:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.apiKey "$XQUIK_API_KEY"
```

MPP mode:

```bash
npm i mppx viem
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.tempoSigningKey "$MPP_SIGNING_KEY"
```

## Base URL

The default API base URL is `https://xquik.com`. Only change it for a trusted Xquik-compatible HTTPS API:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.baseUrl "https://xquik.com"
```

TweetClaw rejects non-HTTPS URLs and URLs with embedded credentials.

## Event Polling

Polling is optional runtime behavior for monitor events the user already created. It does not create monitors, scan targets, post content, or change account state.

Disable polling in isolated install tests unless notification delivery is under test:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.pollingEnabled false
```

The default interval is 60 seconds. The config schema and runtime normalize the interval to a minimum of 5 seconds:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.pollingInterval 60
```

## First Checks

Use `explore` before live calls:

```json
{ "query": "tweet search", "limit": 5 }
```

For MPP mode, filter for eligible endpoints:

```json
{ "mpp": true, "method": "GET", "limit": 25 }
```

For live calls, pass only catalog-listed `/api/v1/...` paths. Put query parameters in the `query` object, not inside the path string.

## Troubleshooting

If install fails, verify OpenClaw is at least `2026.5.4` and install the published package.

If tools are not visible, inspect runtime loading and set `tools.alsoAllow` for `explore` and `tweetclaw`.

If live calls return setup guidance, configure either `apiKey` or `tempoSigningKey`.

If an MPP call is rejected, use `explore` with `mpp: true`. MPP covers 31 read-only endpoints. Media download is not MPP-eligible because it creates account-tied gallery links and requires authenticated access. The MPP user media endpoint returns media-tweet timeline posts, not media files.

If a path is rejected, remove embedded query strings and fragments from the path, then provide query fields through the structured `query` object.
