Search tweets, search tweet replies, post tweets, post tweet replies, export
followers, monitor X/Twitter, manage media, send direct messages, and run
giveaway draws from [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

Use TweetClaw as an OpenClaw tweet scraper and X/Twitter automation plugin. Search tweets, search tweet replies, post tweets, post tweet replies, scrape tweets, run follower export, perform user lookup, handle media upload and media download, send direct messages, monitor tweets, deliver webhooks, and run giveaway draws. Powered by [Xquik](https://xquik.com), the all-in-one X automation platform.

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install @xquik/tweetclaw
```

This command installs the official npm package `@xquik/tweetclaw`. The [ClawHub discovery page](https://clawhub.ai/plugins/@xquik/tweetclaw) remains useful for browsing, but npm is the canonical install source while the ClawHub listing lags behind the npm release.

TweetClaw can be installed before credentials are configured. Until you add an API key or MPP signing key, the free `explore` catalog remains available and live API calls return setup guidance instead of failing plugin installation.

Agent-skill installers can also discover TweetClaw through [Skills.sh](https://skills.sh/xquik-dev/tweetclaw). This installs the packaged `SKILL.md` for agents that use skills directories; use the OpenClaw command above for the plugin runtime.

```bash
npx skills add xquik-dev/tweetclaw
```

> **Note:** `@xquik/tweetclaw` is the only official npm package. Any other scope (for example `@intentsolutionsio/tweetclaw`) is an unofficial redistribution and may ship stale metadata or outdated endpoint counts.

## Pricing

TweetClaw uses Xquik billing for account-backed automation, credit top-ups, and
optional MPP pay-per-use reads. See [Billing & Pricing](https://docs.xquik.com/guides/billing)
for the current plans, eligible endpoints, and operation costs.

## Configure

### Option A: API key (account-backed X automation)

Get an API key at [dashboard.xquik.com](https://dashboard.xquik.com/). Store it in an environment variable and configure TweetClaw to use it:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.apiKey "$XQUIK_API_KEY"
```

**Security**: Keep the key out of chats, docs, and shell history. Prefer the environment-variable command above so OpenClaw writes the secret to its local config without exposing it in the prompt.

### Option B: Credits (pay-per-use, no subscription)

Top up credits from the Xquik dashboard. TweetClaw does not create checkout sessions or charge saved payment methods from the agent.

### Option C: MPP pay-per-use (no account needed, 31 read-only endpoints)

MPP (Machine Payments Protocol) lets agents pay per API call without an account, API key, or subscription. 31 read-only endpoints. Create an MPP account with `mppx account create`. The signing key stays local and is only used to sign payment proofs.

```bash
npm i mppx viem
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.tempoSigningKey "$MPP_SIGNING_KEY"
```

**Security**: Keep the signing key out of chats, docs, and shell history. Prefer the environment-variable command above so OpenClaw writes the secret to its local config without exposing it in the prompt.

MPP-eligible read endpoints include tweet lookup, tweet search, user lookup,
user tweets, follower checks, articles, trends, quotes, replies, retweeters,
favoriters, threads, user likes, user media timeline reads, communities, lists,
users batch lookup, people search, followers, following, mentions, and verified
followers. See the billing guide for current endpoint eligibility and costs.

Media downloads and gallery creation are not MPP-eligible. The user media endpoint returns a user's media-tweet timeline; it does not download files or create gallery links.

### Enable the optional action tool

OpenClaw loads `explore` as the safe catalog tool. The live endpoint invoker, `tweetclaw`, is registered as an optional tool because it can perform paid reads, private reads, and write actions.

OpenClaw's local onboarding default is often `tools.profile: "coding"`, which excludes external plugin tools from agent runs until they are explicitly allowed. If the agent can see the TweetClaw skill but cannot call the tools, add the tool names to `tools.alsoAllow` so you keep the normal coding tools and opt into TweetClaw.

```bash
openclaw config set tools.alsoAllow '["explore", "tweetclaw"]'
```

Verify runtime registration after install or update:

```bash
openclaw plugins inspect tweetclaw --runtime
openclaw skills info tweetclaw
```

### Optional settings

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.baseUrl "https://xquik.com"
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.pollingEnabled true
openclaw config set plugins.entries.tweetclaw.config.pollingInterval 60
```

Only change `baseUrl` for a self-hosted Xquik-compatible API. TweetClaw requires an HTTPS base URL with no embedded credentials.

## Tools

TweetClaw uses 2 structured tools for the agent-safe endpoint catalog:

### `explore` (free, no network)

Search the API spec to find endpoints. No API calls are made.

```
You: "What endpoints are available for tweet composition?"

AI uses explore → filters spec by category "composition"
→ Returns matching endpoints with parameters and response shapes
```

### `tweetclaw` (invoke API endpoints)

Invoke catalog-listed API endpoints with structured `path`, `method`, `query`, and `body` fields. Auth is injected automatically - the LLM never sees your API key.

This tool is optional in OpenClaw. If your agent can see the skill but cannot call TweetClaw tools, add `explore` and `tweetclaw` to `tools.alsoAllow` so your normal tool profile stays intact.

OpenClaw approval prompts are enforced before write-like `tweetclaw` tool calls. Review the structured request before approving any post, delete, follow, DM, monitor, extraction, webhook, or profile-change action.

```
You: "Post a tweet saying 'Hello from TweetClaw!'"

AI uses tweetclaw → finds connected account, posts tweet
→ Returns { tweetId, success: true }
```

```
You: "Search tweets about AI agents"

AI uses explore → finds /api/v1/x/tweets/search
AI uses tweetclaw → calls the endpoint with auth
→ Returns tweet results
```

## Commands

Instant responses, no LLM needed:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/xstatus` | Account info, subscription status, usage, credit balance |
| `/xtrends` | Trending topics from curated sources |
| `/xtrends tech` | Trending topics filtered by category |

## Event Notifications

When polling is enabled (default), TweetClaw checks for new events every 60 seconds and delivers them to your chat:

- **Monitor alerts**: New tweets, replies, quotes, retweets from monitored accounts

Set up a monitor first:

```
You: "Monitor @elonmusk for new tweets, replies, and retweets"
```

## API Coverage

99 agent-callable endpoints across 9 categories. Dashboard-only account-admin, billing, support, and raw credential flows are excluded from the tool catalog and blocked at runtime.

| Category | Examples | Access |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Account** | Account status | Account-backed |
| **Composition** | Compose, drafts, writing styles, radar | Account-backed |
| **Credits** | Check balance | Account-backed |
| **Extraction** | 23 extraction tools, giveaway draws, exports | Account-backed |
| **Media** | Upload media via URL, authenticated media download, gallery links | Account-backed |
| **Monitoring** | Create monitors, view events, manage webhooks | Account-backed |
| **Twitter** | Search, lookups, timelines, articles, trends, bookmarks, notifications | Account-backed or MPP where eligible |
| **X Accounts** | List connected account handles for explicit user-selected actions | Account-backed |
| **X Write** | Post, reply, like, retweet, follow, remove follower, DM, profile, communities | Account-backed with approval |

Media download requires authenticated access and is not MPP-eligible. MPP only includes media-tweet timeline reads, not file download or gallery creation.
