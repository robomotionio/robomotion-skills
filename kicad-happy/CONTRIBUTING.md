### Zero-dependency policy

All analysis scripts use Python 3.8+ standard library only. No pip install, no Docker, no KiCad installation needed. This is a hard requirement — it means the scripts run anywhere with a Python interpreter.

Optional dependencies (`requests`, `playwright`) are only used for datasheet downloading and web scraping fallbacks. They are never imported by the core analysis path.

## How signal detectors work

The analysis pipeline runs in three phases:

1. **Parse** — `analyze_schematic.py` reads the KiCad S-expression file, extracts components, nets, and pins, and builds an `AnalysisContext` object.

2. **Detect** — `analyze_signal_paths()` calls each detector function in order. Each detector receives the `AnalysisContext` (and sometimes prior detector results for cross-referencing) and returns a list of findings.

3. **Report** — Results are assembled into JSON output or consumed by the agent to write a design review.

### AnalysisContext

Every detector receives an `AnalysisContext` (`kicad_types.py`) — a dataclass containing:

- `components` — list of all parsed components
- `nets` — dict of net name to net info (pins, labels)
- `comp_lookup` — dict of reference to component (O(1) lookup)
- `parsed_values` — dict of reference to parsed numeric value
- `known_power_rails` — set of net names connected to power symbols
- `ref_pins` — reverse index: reference to {pin_num: (net_name, net_id)}
- `pin_net` — forward index: (reference, pin_num) to (net_name, net_id)
- `nq` — optional `NetlistQueries` object for multi-hop net tracing
- Helper methods: `is_power_net()`, `is_ground()`, `get_two_pin_nets()`

### Writing a new detector

Detectors live in one of two files:

- `signal_detectors.py` — core circuit analysis (regulators, filters, dividers, opamps, transistors, crystals, protection, current sense, decoupling)
- `domain_detectors.py` — domain-specific / application-level detectors (interfaces, peripherals, power path, sensors, audio, LEDs)

A detector function follows this pattern:

```python
def detect_my_circuit(ctx: AnalysisContext, prior_results=None) -> list[dict]:
    """Detect [circuit type] and validate [what]."""
    findings = []
    for comp in ctx.components:
        # 1. Identify candidate components by type, lib_id, value, or reference prefix
        if not _is_candidate(comp):
            continue
        # 2. Trace connected nets to find related components
        neighbors = _get_net_components(ctx, net_name, comp["reference"])
        # 3. Compute derived values (voltage, frequency, current, etc.)
        # 4. Check against rules/thresholds
        # 5. Append findings with severity
        findings.append({
            "type": "my_circuit",
            "reference": comp["reference"],
            "severity": "WARNING",  # or INFO, SUGGESTION
            "details": { ... }
        })
    return findings
```

Then register it in `analyze_schematic.py`'s `analyze_signal_paths()` function, where the detector call order is defined.

### Adding an EMC rule

EMC rules live in `emc/scripts/emc_rules.py`. Each rule:

1. Has an ID (e.g., `DC-006`) following the category prefix convention
2. Receives schematic JSON, PCB JSON, and config
3. Returns findings built via `_make_finding()` with `severity` (`error`, `warning`, `info`), `confidence` (`deterministic`, `heuristic`, `datasheet-backed`), and an `evidence_source` tag
4. Should include an equation tag comment (e.g., `# EQ-097: ...`) inside the function body above the math expression, with a `# Source:` citation line

All formulas should reference a primary source (textbook, app note, standard) in the equation tag.

## How to add a new skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: One paragraph describing what this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger phrases.
---
```

2. Add any scripts to `skills/<name>/scripts/`
3. Add a symlink in `.agents/skills/`: `ln -s ../../skills/<name> .agents/skills/<name>`
    *   **Gemini CLI:** Use `gemini skills link . --scope workspace` to link the whole repo.
4. Update the manual install lists in `README.md` (both Claude Code and Codex sections)
5. Validate:
    *   **Claude Code:** `claude plugin validate .`
    *   **Gemini CLI:** Run `/skills reload` in an active session to verify discovery.

Keep SKILL.md language agent-neutral — use "the agent" instead of "Claude", "use web search" instead of "WebSearch", etc.

## Running the analysis scripts

```bash
# Schematic analysis
python3 skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_schematic.py <file>.kicad_sch
python3 skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_schematic.py <file>.kicad_sch --output analysis.json

# PCB layout analysis
python3 skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_pcb.py <file>.kicad_pcb
python3 skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_pcb.py <file>.kicad_pcb --full --output pcb.json

# Gerber verification
python3 skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_gerbers.py <gerber_dir>/

# EMC pre-compliance (requires schematic + PCB JSON)
python3 skills/emc/scripts/analyze_emc.py --schematic sch.json --pcb pcb.json

# Thermal analysis
python3 skills/kicad/scripts/analyze_thermal.py --schematic sch.json --pcb pcb.json
```

All scripts exit 0 on success. The schematic and PCB analyzers produce JSON to stdout (or to a file with `--output`). EMC and thermal produce a structured risk report.

## Test harness

Changes to any analysis script must be validated against the [test harness](https://github.com/aklofas/kicad-happy-testharness) — a corpus of 5,829 real-world KiCad projects spanning hobby boards, production hardware, motor controllers, RF frontends, battery management systems, IoT devices, audio amplifiers, and more. KiCad 5 through 10.

### What the harness checks

| Layer | What it catches | How |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| **Crash testing** | Parser errors, unhandled exceptions, edge cases | Runs every analyzer against every file in the corpus |
| **Regression assertions** | Output drift, lost detections, changed values | 2M+ assertions on known-good outputs |
| **Bugfix guards** | Previously fixed bugs returning | Targeted assertions on specific past failures |
| **Equation audits** | Formula correctness | 107 equations tracked with primary source citations |
| **Constant audits** | Magic numbers drifting | 105+ switching frequencies + other constants tracked, 0 critical-risk |
| **Schema drift** | Analyzer `--schema` output diverging from emitted JSON | Symmetric-difference check across all 8 analyzers |

### Running the harness

The harness lives in a separate repo (`kicad-happy-testharness`). After making changes:

```bash
# Clone the harness (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/aklofas/kicad-happy-testharness.git

# Run schematic analyzer across full corpus (parallel)
python3 run/run_schematic.py --jobs 16

# Run EMC analyzer across full corpus
python3 run/run_emc.py --jobs 16

# Run regression assertions
python3 regression/run_checks.py --type schematic
python3 regression/run_checks.py --type emc
```

The target is 100% pass rate across all assertion types. Any regression should be investigated — not suppressed.

### When to re-seed assertions

If your change intentionally changes analyzer output (new fields, changed detection logic, corrected calculations), you'll need to re-seed affected assertions. The harness RUNBOOK covers this in detail. The key principle: re-seed only the assertions your change affects, and verify the new values are correct before committing.

### Writing a test plan for new features

For significant new features, write a test plan that the harness can execute:

1. Create a `TODO-<feature>-test-plan.md` in the harness repo root
2. Define phases with specific pass/fail criteria
3. Include corpus-wide checks (crash rate, false positive rate, detection count)
4. Include targeted checks on specific repos where the feature should trigger

The harness agent executes test plans and reports results. After validation, the test plan file is deleted and results are archived.

## Code style

- **Python 3.8+ compatibility** — no walrus operators, no `match` statements, no `type` aliases. Use `from __future__ import annotations` for modern type hints.
- **No external dependencies** in analysis scripts — stdlib only.
- **Functions over classes** — detectors are plain functions that take `AnalysisContext` and return lists.
- **Inline comments for equations** — tag with `# EQ-NNN: formula_name (source)` so the harness can track them.
- **No dead code** — if it's not called, delete it. The harness catches regressions; you don't need commented-out fallbacks.

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Run the analysis scripts on at least one real KiCad project to sanity-check
4. Run the test harness if you have it set up (or describe your testing in the PR)
5. Open a PR — the GitHub Action will run deterministic analysis as a CI check

For changes to signal detectors or EMC rules, include in the PR description:
- How many repos in the corpus the detector fires on (if known)
- Any false positive mitigation you've done
- The primary source for any new formulas or thresholds
