# EMC Pre-Compliance Guide

Deep-dive into how the EMC pre-compliance skill works, what it checks, the physics behind the formulas, and how to use the results.

## How It Works

The EMC skill reads the output of the schematic and PCB analyzers, cross-references frequency data (switching regulators, clocks, bus speeds) against PCB geometry (trace routing, zone coverage, component placement, via stitching, stackup), and identifies the most common causes of EMC test failures.

```
KiCad schematic
  -> analyze_schematic.py -> schematic.json (frequencies, subcircuits, protection devices)

KiCad PCB
  -> analyze_pcb.py --full -> pcb.json (traces, zones, vias, stackup, placement)

Both JSONs
  -> analyze_emc.py -> emc.json (findings, risk score, test plan, regulatory coverage)
```

No external tools required — all checks work with analytical formulas alone. When ngspice, LTspice, or Xyce is available, the `--spice-enhanced` flag enables SPICE-verified PDN impedance and EMI filter insertion loss analysis for higher accuracy. Without a simulator, the analytical path runs unchanged.

## The Physics

### Differential-mode loop radiation

The fundamental emission mechanism. A current loop on the PCB radiates:

```
E = 2.632 x 10^-14 x f^2 x A x I / r   (V/m, with ground plane image)
```

Where f = frequency (Hz), A = loop area (m^2), I = current (A), r = distance (m).

**Key scaling rules:**
- Double the loop area: +6 dB emissions
- Double the frequency: +12 dB emissions (f^2 dependence)
- Double the current: +6 dB emissions

This is why ground plane voids are so critical — they force return currents to detour, creating large unintentional loops.

Ref: Ott, *Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineering* (Wiley, 2009), Ch. 6; Paul, *Introduction to Electromagnetic Compatibility* (Wiley, 2006), Ch. 10.

### Common-mode cable radiation

The dominant emission path for cable-connected products:

```
E = 1.257 x 10^-6 x f x L x I_CM / r   (V/m)
```

Where L = cable length (m), I_CM = common-mode current (A). Just **5 microamps** of CM current on a 1m cable at 100 MHz exceeds FCC Class B limits.

Ref: Ott, Ch. 6; [LearnEMC CM EMI Calculator](https://learnemc.com/ext/calculators/mremc/cmode.php).

### Switching regulator harmonics

A trapezoidal switching waveform produces harmonics with a predictable envelope:
- Flat to f1 = 1/(pi x tau) where tau = pulse width
- -20 dB/decade rolloff to f2 = 1/(pi x t_r) where t_r = rise time
- -40 dB/decade rolloff above f2

A 500 kHz buck converter has its 60th-176th harmonics in the FCC 30-88 MHz test band. Minimizing the switching loop area is the primary mitigation.

Ref: Paul, *Introduction to EMC*, Ch. 3.

### Differential pair skew

Length mismatch between differential pair traces creates common-mode voltage:

```
V_CM = V_diff x skew / (2 x T_rise)
```

For USB HS (V_diff=400mV, T_rise=500ps), a 4mm mismatch creates ~8.8mV of CM voltage — enough to measurably increase cable emissions. Protocol-specific skew limits: USB HS 25ps, PCIe 5ps, Ethernet 50ps, HDMI 20ps.

Ref: Ott, Ch. 19; Johnson, *High-Speed Signal Propagation*, Ch. 11.

### Board cavity resonance

The power/ground plane pair forms a parallel-plate cavity that resonates at:

```
f_mn = (c / 2*sqrt(er)) x sqrt((m/L)^2 + (n/W)^2)
```

At these frequencies, PDN impedance spikes and emissions increase. For a 100x80mm FR4 board, the first resonance is at ~715 MHz.

The `--market` flag selects all applicable standards for a target market:

| Market | Standards applied |
|--------|-------------------|
| `us` | FCC Part 15 (radiated + conducted) |

| `military` | MIL-STD-461G RE102/CE102/CS114/CS116/CS118 |

## Risk Scoring

Each rule ID contributes at most 3 findings to the score (taking the worst severity first). This prevents per-net rules like GP-001 — which fires once per net with poor ground plane coverage — from saturating the score to 0 on 2-layer boards with many nets. All findings are still reported in the output; only the summary score is capped.

```
penalty = sum(worst 3 findings per rule × severity weight)
score = max(0, 100 - penalty)
```

Severity weights: CRITICAL=15, HIGH=8, MEDIUM=3, LOW=1, INFO=0.

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|
| 90-100 | Low EMC risk — basic hygiene checks pass |
| 70-89 | Moderate risk — some issues to address |
| 50-69 | Significant risk — multiple issues likely to cause failures |
| <50 | High risk — fundamental design issues |

## Per-Net Scoring

In addition to the board-level risk score, the analyzer computes a per-net EMC score. Each net that appears in any finding gets its own score using the same formula. This lets you identify the highest-risk signals at a glance:

```
Highest-risk nets:
  SPI_CLK: 67/100 (3 findings: GP-001, CK-001, BE-001)
  USB_DP:  84/100 (2 findings: DP-001, DP-004)
  USB_DM:  84/100 (2 findings: DP-001, DP-004)
  SW_NODE: 92/100 (1 finding: SW-002)
```

Output as `per_net_scores` in the JSON, sorted worst-first.

## Pre-Compliance Test Plan

The analyzer generates a test plan to help you prepare for lab testing:

**Frequency band prioritization** — ranks FCC/CISPR frequency bands by number of emission sources (switching regulator harmonics, clock harmonics, protocol frequencies). Focus your near-field probing and pre-scan on the highest-risk bands first.

**Interface risk ranking** — scores each external connector by protocol speed and filter/ESD presence. The highest-scoring interface is most likely to cause cable radiation failures.

**Suggested probe points** — lists XY coordinates of switching inductors, crystal oscillators, and unfiltered connectors. These are the spots to probe during near-field scanning.

## SPICE-Enhanced Mode

When a SPICE simulator is available (ngspice, LTspice, or Xyce), the `--spice-enhanced` flag improves four areas:

**PDN impedance (PD-001, PD-002)** — Instead of the analytical parallel-RLC model, SPICE runs an actual AC sweep of the decoupling network. This captures phase interactions between capacitors that the analytical model misses, particularly at anti-resonance peaks. In testing, SPICE found a 33 ohm anti-resonance peak where the analytical model estimated 3.4 ohm — a 10x difference that could mean the difference between catching a real PDN problem and missing it.

**SPICE-verified cap suggestions** — When PD-001 flags an anti-resonance peak, the tool computes a specific cap value whose SRF fills the gap (rounded to E12 standard values), then re-runs the SPICE sweep with the suggested cap added to verify the peak is resolved. The recommendation includes the exact component value and verification result: "Add 220pF 0603 MLCC (SPICE-verified: peak reduced from 33.5 ohm to 8.9 ohm)."

**EMI filter insertion loss (EF-001, EF-002)** — Instead of just checking cutoff frequency vs switching frequency, SPICE simulates the actual insertion loss including capacitor parasitics. Reports attenuation in dB at the switching frequency and its 3rd harmonic.

**Switching harmonic FFT (EE-002)** — Instead of the analytical trapezoidal envelope approximation, runs a transient SPICE simulation of the switching waveform and extracts actual harmonic amplitudes using the Goertzel algorithm. EE-002 findings show SPICE FFT results alongside the analytical envelope for comparison.

```bash
# Enable SPICE-enhanced mode
python3 analyze_emc.py --schematic sch.json --pcb pcb.json --spice-enhanced

# The GitHub Action enables this automatically when ngspice is installed
```

Findings from SPICE-enhanced checks are annotated "(SPICE-verified)" in the description and receive 1.5x weight in per-net scoring. Without a simulator, the analytical model runs unchanged and findings are annotated "(analytical)".

## Limitations

**What this analyzer cannot do:**
- Predict absolute emission levels better than +/-10-20 dB
- Account for enclosure effects (shielding, apertures, seams)
- Predict cable radiation without knowing external cable routing and length
- Replace full-wave simulation for complex geometries
- Guarantee compliance — only a calibrated measurement in an accredited lab can do that

**What it does well:**
- Catch ~70% of common EMC design mistakes before fabrication
- Prioritize the most likely problem areas for review
- Provide quantitative relative risk scoring
- Generate a checklist for pre-compliance lab testing
- Reduce first-spin failure rate (industry estimate: ~50% fail EMC on first attempt)
