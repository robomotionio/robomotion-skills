## What this skill helps with

`rails-conventions` is for real production work in Rails codebases where consistency matters.

It guides agents to:

- inspect local patterns first (models, controllers, routes, tests, deploy setup)
- keep naming and architecture aligned with existing conventions
- write backend-aware job code (`good_job` or `solid_queue`) without assumptions
- catch risks early in security, performance, and test coverage

## Coverage

- Rails 8 baseline and compatibility constraints
- Naming, layering, and code organization
- Active Record modeling and migration discipline
- Controllers, params, and response semantics
- REST/resource-focused routing
- Hotwire/Turbo/Stimulus patterns
- Background jobs (adapter detection + backend-specific guidance)
- Performance and caching strategy
- Security checklist
- Testing strategy (Minitest/RSpec alignment)
- API and serialization conventions
- Optional 37signals-inspired profile

## Validate and package

You can use [`agent_skills`](https://github.com/rubyonai/agent_skills) for standard validation and packaging.

```bash
# install CLI
gem install agent_skills

# validate
agent-skills validate ./skills/rails-conventions

# package
agent-skills pack ./skills/rails-conventions

# inspect metadata
agent-skills info ./skills/rails-conventions
```

## Example trigger

Use this skill when a request sounds like:

```text
Implement a new billing webhook endpoint in this Rails app, matching existing conventions and tests.
```
